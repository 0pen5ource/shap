    "# The monotonicity axiom implies the symmetry axiom for Shapley values\n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value\">Shapley values</a> are a well known way in coalitional game theory of assigning credit for an outcome among a set of players. Since any arbitrary mapping between player sets and outcomes is possible, how to assign individual credit can be unclear. The Shapley values are one such way of assigning credit and, importantly, they are the only way that satifies some very basic and desirable properties. Typically these properties are given as four axioms, where the Shapley values are the only credit assignment method that satisfies all four axioms:\n",
